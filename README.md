# 🚦 AI-Driven Traffic Violation Detection System

An intelligent traffic monitoring system that uses **Computer Vision and Deep Learning** to automatically detect traffic violations such as **red-light jumping, over-speeding, and seat-belt violations** from CCTV footage.

This project aims to reduce manual monitoring, improve road safety, and support smart city infrastructure with automated violation detection.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1️⃣ CCTV footage is processed frame-by-frame.  
2️⃣ YOLO detects vehicles in real time.  
3️⃣ The system analyzes vehicle movement and traffic signals.  
4️⃣ Violations are identified automatically.  
5️⃣ Evidence is stored with timestamps for reporting.
